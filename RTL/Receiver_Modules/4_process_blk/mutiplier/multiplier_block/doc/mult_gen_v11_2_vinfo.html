5. KNOWN ISSUES & LIMITATIONS

  The following are known issues for this core at time of release:

  5.1 ISE
    - Output bus indices in .ASY file do not match instantiation template bus indices
      when a custom output width is selected.
       - The indices of the P output bus will be P[X:Y] in the .ASY file and P[X-Y:0] in
         the core instantiation template.
       - Affects schematic flow only.
       - Manually editing the .ASY file to correct the bus width can work around this issue.
       - CR456322 and CR435084
       - Answer Record 30807

    - Block Memory resource estimates may be inaccurate for constant-coefficient multipliers
      with large constants and large A input widths (&gt; 35 bits)
       - The map report should be consulted to determine the true block memory count
       - CR469169
       - Answer Record 30810

  5.2 Vivado
    - For LUT-based multipliers optimized for area, with at least one operand greater than or equal
      to 60 bits wide, and with at least one operand Signed, the netlist produced by Vivado Synthesis
      is incorrect.
       - This manifests as 'X' output values being produced by the netlist when simulated.
       - The core may be configured to use speed optimization for a LUT-based multiplier, or may be
         configured to use DSP48 resources instead, to provide equivalent functionality.
       - CR679404
